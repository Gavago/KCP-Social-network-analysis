# within years, randomly sample and replace nodes of networks
# create 1000 randomized versions of 2009 - 2017 networks
# save to extract network measures on
# turn network measures into distrubtions to then test for signicance in e.g. integration in a given year,
# changes in integration from year to year, etc.
